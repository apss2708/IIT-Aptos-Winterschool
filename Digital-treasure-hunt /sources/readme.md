# Digital Treasure Hunt using NFTs

## Project Title
**Digital Treasure Hunt using NFTs** - A blockchain-based treasure hunting game powered by Aptos Move smart contracts.

## Project Description
This project implements a decentralized treasure hunting game where players can discover and claim NFT-based digital treasures scattered across various locations. Each treasure is represented as a unique NFT containing encrypted location clues and reward information. Players must solve clues, find the correct locations, and provide proof to claim their treasure rewards.

The smart contract manages the entire treasure hunt ecosystem, including treasure creation, location verification, and reward distribution. Game masters can create treasure hunts with multiple NFT treasures, each containing unique rewards that players can claim upon successful discovery.

## Project Vision
To revolutionize location-based gaming by combining the excitement of treasure hunting with blockchain technology. Our vision is to create an immersive, trustless gaming experience where players can participate in real-world treasure hunts while earning verifiable digital rewards through NFT ownership.

We aim to bridge the gap between physical exploration and digital ownership, encouraging outdoor activities and community engagement while leveraging the transparency and security of blockchain technology.
